Solution: 
This function loops through each character in the string and creates all possible consecutive substrings starting from that character. 
It uses a nested loop: Outer loop picks the stsarting index, and inner loop builds each substring by appending one character at a time.

Pseudocode

SET result to empty array
FOR start from 0 to end of string 
    SET substring to empty string 
    FOR end from start to end of string 
        APPEND character at index end to substring 
        PUSH substring to result 
Return result
